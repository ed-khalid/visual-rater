### CURRENT 
# BUGS
- Navfilter doesn't work correclty when things are on rater
- adding one album doesn't work 
- cannot add two artists together 
# NAV-FILTER
- doesn't work properly when two albums are open. work on (removing filters better) 
- standardize the scoring coloring themes (right now they're adhoc) - create a dummy album with all categories accounted for   
# GENERAL RATER
- add a context 

# GRID-RATER
- left-handside column labels: rotate and align to outer left border
- account for small data state update flicker when song score is to be updated    
- layout gridblock better (dynamic size? label moving around when items are added? what to do when too many items...)
